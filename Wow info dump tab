>Among them is a level 43 epic staff world drop, you can just buy from the AH. Being the best tanking weapon in the game.

The best tanking ring for you is a blue item quest reward and a ring from MC.

The best trinket you will keep using forever is something you get in the first days of hitting 60 from Onyxia attunement.

The best gloves and boots are from getting PvP rank 12 which is very achievable compared to rank 14.

The best helmet is a level 40 blue item any tribal leatherworker can make for you, so good its better than T6 helm into TBC.

The best DPS weapon, you basically get by hitting exalted in AV since weapon DPS is irrelevant for druids in vanilla. This means unstoppable force is equal to toptier/highend weapons for druids and the list goes on.

Aoe Grinding Set up
http://www.wowhead.com/?talent=0xG0uicsIzbhz
INt + Spellpower and stam when possible
" regrowth / rejuvenation -> Boomkin form -> pull mobs with insect swarm (does plenty of damage and cost low mana)I pull 8-12 mobs depending on lvl (8 if your lvl + 2, 12 if your lvl -2) -> cast barkskin -> cast typhoon -> cast hurricane... and that should do it. That should take down all the mobs. You might have to cast another hurricane, and if you dont have mana enough for that, cast insect swarm or wrath. 
Heal up, drink, rinse and repeat."
Get improved hurricane, starfall does great dmg, keep thorns up

///Feral druids can also AOE quite easily.

1. grab a bunch of mobs 
2. Bear form
3. Enrage
4. Swipe and maul 
5. AP debuff or barsking if you have troubles.////
